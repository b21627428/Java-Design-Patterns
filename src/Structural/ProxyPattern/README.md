## Proxy Pattern

<ul style="font-size: 16px">
<li>
Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p style="font-size: 16px">
The Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original objectâ€™s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it.
